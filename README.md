Get ready to drive into Vue.js and Firebase with a home-made To Do List!

HacKSU teaches anyone no matter what major or coding experience how to program and this week for week 8 we are working with Vue.js and Firebase storage.

Let's Get Started:
   1.  We are going to follow through the template.html to set up the form. Each line is commented and I will go through this manually during the lesson 

   2. We will work on the firebase.js file and learn more about Firebase. Everyone will need to make a free account and login to make a new application.

         To make a new application, 
                 1. Log into Firebase
                 2. Create a new project
                 3. Give it a name 
    
        After the project is created we will need specific information about the project to access the database correctly. <br>
              `var config = { apiKey: "AIzaSyDE_O5p2wYbsDnnqGga11XXZxpOp1nLmlI",`<br>
              `authDomain: "test-17c76.firebaseapp.com", `<br>
              `databaseURL: "https://test-17c76.firebaseio.com", `<br>
              `projectId: "test-17c76",`<br>
              `storageBucket: "",` <br>
              `messagingSenderId: "855722645833"};`<br>
        
        We will update the above code to match your database during the lesson.

   3.Once Firebase is correctly connected, we will code the rest of the JS file. Each line is commented with importatn information. Please feel free to ask questions! :)

   4.Lastly, we will style the application to make it look user friendly.

Congradulations! You now have a working To Do List that you can use everyday! Go get some amaxing stuff done you go-getter! :)
